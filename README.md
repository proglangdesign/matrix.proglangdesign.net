# matrix.qipl.org

This repository includes various configuration files for the matrix.qipl.org service.
matrix.qipl.org's primary purpose is to bridge #proglangdesign on Freenode and #irc-bridge on the [/r/ProgrammingLanguages Discord](https://discord.gg/4Kjt3ZE).

It also contains a complete mapping of the Discord to Matrix, so you are also welcome to use the service directly if you would rather avoid using the proprietary Discord client.
There is [a webchat](https://matrix.qipl.org) which was created specifically for this purpose.
